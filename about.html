<p class="lead">Hi, my name is Dmitry and I have over 10 years of experience in web design and development. I am based in Brooklyn, NY. In 1998, I received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Graphics Design from the Fashion Institute of Technology, New York. I specialize in designing beautiful and easy to use websites.</p>
<p class="lead">Throughout my experiences, I have developed solid knowledge of Photoshop, Illustrator, Dreamweaver as well as web development technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and AJAX. I am also experienced working with content management systems, WordPress, blogs and social media websites. Having a background in both design and development allows me to easily work alongside other developers on large scale projects.</p>
<p class="lead">I approach all projects with enthusiasm and effectiveness. If you would like me to take on your project, I would love to hear from you!</p>
