      <p><h3>Trading Interfaces</h3></p>
      <p> <strong>Project Summary</strong> <br>Barclays Capital Sales Trade Entry Application windows were difficult to work with due to the poor, confusing layout, lack of colors and icons. Working with Java Developers and stakeholders I created clearer interfaces with complex sections clearly divided for better user interaction.</p>

      <p><h3>Sales Workstation Home Page</h3></p>
      <p> <strong>Project Summary</strong> <br>The original design didn't harmonize well with the rest of <a href="http://www.barcap.com">barcap.com</a> intranet. In creating my design, I made sure the color scheme, icons, and the layout is consistent with rest of the site. I also worked with main users to make sure the interface is clear and easy to navigate.</p>

      <p><h3>Sales Workstation Splash Screen</h3></p>
      <p> <strong>Project Summary</strong> 
      <br>
Sales Workstation, which is a Sales Trade Entry Application was built in Java and presented a standard "Java loadingâ€¦" splash screen. Working with stakeholders and developers I created an image that conveys business aspect of the application. I also chose colors and graphical elements that are consitent with the look of the application itself.
