We demand a lot from our "user interfaces" these days. They must be powerful and visually appealing while also being fast and easy to use. We expect them to anticipate our needs but not force us into a particular path. Effective User Interface Design is about helping people to accomplish desired tasks in a way that makes sense to them. Specific design solutions may vary across different platforms (such as websites, applications, and handhelds) and different industries, but the ultimate goal is always the same: to provide an experience that is efficient and satisfying. My design process insures that an interface achieves the delicate balance of innovation and familiarity that is required for a successful interaction.

  <h2>Process</h2>
<ol class="numbered-list">
<li><p><strong>Functionality requirements gathering.</strong> Assembling a list of the functionality required by the website/application to accomplish the goals of the project and the potential needs of the users.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>User analysis.</strong> Defining personas and scenarios to describe different types of users, their specific goals and how they might use the website/application to accomplish those goals. A robust set of personas and scenarios serves as a valuable framework for creating and evaluating the design.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Information architecture.</strong> An effective information architecture makes it easy for users to find what theyâ€™re looking for. I illustrate information architecture with site maps and process flow charts. The process flow charts illustrate the steps users will take to complete key scenarios.</p></li>
    
<li><p><strong>Prototyping.</strong> Development of wireframes and simple interactive screens. These prototypes are stripped of all look & feel elements and most content in order to concentrate on the interface. Serving as blueprints for the user experience, wireframes define the basic layout of each page and illustrate how interactive elements will behave.</p></li>
    
<li><p><strong>Usability testing.</strong> Testing of the prototypes on an actual user and asking him/her to talk about their thoughts during the experience.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Graphic Interface design.</strong> Actual look & feel design of the final graphical user interface (GUI). It may be based on the findings developed during the usability testing if usability is unpredictable, or based on communication objectives and styles that would appeal to the user.</p></li>
