I create websites that offer an effortless user experience, achieve high rankings on the major search engines, and promote your business and brand to your target audience. Using my design skills, I translate your message into the digital language of content, functionality and images essential to building sites that bring visitors back again and again.
<p></p>
I strive to balance the marketing goals of my clients with website design best practices and the latest in online technology, while adhering to established brand guidelines to ensure a uniform public identity. My fields of expertise range from optimizing visual design to maximizing the impact of innovations in Internet technology, and from search engine-friendly content development to online ad campaign management. By working closely with my clients to assess their goals, target market and budget, I craft websites that put your company on the virtual map.

  <h2>Website Redesign</h2>

I can help refresh your site's current look and feel, bringing it up to date and making it a more attractive destination for customers and prospects.
<p></p>
If you’re looking for the perfect investment in improving the deliver of your company’s message, a Website Redesign might be exactly what your company needs. Typically, a Website Redesign requires less time and effort than other marketing communication projects such as redesigning the company’s collateral. Given that so many consumers and businesses are spending increasing amounts of time online, this also makes a Website Redesign an attractive brand investment.
<p></p>
Most companies update their websites every 12-24 months to avoid a stale, dated look. Often, depending on how your existing site is architected, I can make it look like an entirely new site with a minimum of disruption to your existing web assets and content.
<p></p>
I start by learning about your business, objectives, marketplace, company culture, and style/branding preferences. I will then work to create a series of individual concepts from which you can select. As part of the design process, I will adjust and refine the design until you’re satisfied.
